Cancer Prediction (Brain Tumor Classification)
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras to classify brain MRI images into four categories: glioma, meningioma, notumor, and pituitary.

Features
Data augmentation for robust training
CNN model with multiple convolutional and pooling layers
Training and validation accuracy/loss plotsModel saving for future inference
Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow
NumPy
Matplotlib
Usage
Place your dataset in the Training and Testing folders (not included in this repo).
Run the s.ipynb notebook in glioma to train and evaluate the model.
The trained model will be saved in the model/ directory (ignored by git).
